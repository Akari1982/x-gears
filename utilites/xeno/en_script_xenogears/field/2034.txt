<TextBlock 13 w:60 h:6>
Elly
"This Deus, the one you call
god, is an 'inter-planetary
invasion weapon system' that
was built in ancient times by
humans from another planet.<New>
It was created as an automatic
weapon which could act upon
its own will to take control
of a targeted planet.<Delay 20> But you
should've known this much from
looking at the Razael records.<New>
Anyway, during a test run,
Deus became uncontrollable.
It released its power and
annihilated a whole planet.<New>
The creators of 'Deus' found
its immeasurable power to be
too much of a threat and hence
forcibly shut it down.<New>
In order to analyze the cause
of the problem, its core was
dismantled and placed on an
inter-planetary emigrant
passenger ship to be
transported to another planet.<New>
Becoming aware of this, the
dissasembled Deus resisted.
It tried to  take over the
passenger ship that was
transporting it.<New>
However, as a last line of
defense against the escape
of Deus, its creators,
unexpectedly destroyed the
whole ship, sending it
crashing to this planet.<New>
Deus knew that it would not
be able to get away from the
explosion or the imminent
impact and so it detached its
core from the 'Zohar' power
reactor."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:28 h:2>

"Zo...har...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, 'Zohar'...
It is what drives all of
the Gears on this planet.<New>
It is the master generator
that transmits its energy
to the slave generators
in our Gears.<New>
It is also the source of
all the Ether power that
the inhabitants of this
planet utilize.<New>
By utilizing the energy
displacements caused by
actualizing potential
future phenomenon...<New>
...this 'Zohar Modifier'
has the ability to produce
infinite amounts of
energy."<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Are you saying all our
energy comes from that one
power reactor or engine?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, but there is more...<New>
The core that was detached 
from Zohar, the 'Biological
Computer Kadomony' crashed
onto this primitive planet.<New>
It activated -Persona-,
its life support plant,
that can generate organic
material.<New>
Using this it prepared for
itself a genetic-based
system for the day when
Deus would be resurrected.<New>
Thus, the first humans were
created from there...<Delay 20>
Emperor Cain and the elders
of the Gazel Ministry."<Close><End of Block>

"Are you saying the Emperor
and them Gazel geezers were
people born from Deus!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:56 h:6>
Elly
"Do you know why the Gazel
Ministry desired the Anima
Relics and your bodies?<Delay 10>
Well, here's the reason...<New>
Before becoming human, the
bodies of the Ministry were
once part of the organic
elements in the core circuit
that made up 'Deus'.<New>
There were two types of
organic elements.
The female type was called
'Anima', while the male
type was called 'Animus'.<New>
They were also created with
the added ability to become
mobile weapons by merging
with machinery that was
suited for use as terminal
interface weapons for Deus.<New>
In other words, those
Omnigears you were using
were one form of such
weapons.<New>
The Ministry, which were
Animus, were to become one
again with their separated
Anima at the time of the
resurrection of god...<New>
But, in a war 500 years ago,
they all lost their physical
bodies.<New>
It was then that they
decided to extract their own
genetic factor from certain
individuals of their human
descendants who carried the
appropriate sets of D.N.A..<New>
All so each of them could
become one with their
respective Anima again."<Close><End of Block>

"Yes, you humans are all
descendants of Cain and
the Gazel Ministry...<New>
They were born from the
-Persona-, gave birth,
and propagated.<New>
They followed their
inbuilt program to
someday resurrect the
heavily damaged Deus."<Close><End of Block>

to resurrect Deus!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"Yes.<Delay 20>
But it wasn't just to
restore its old body.<New>
More than half of Deus is
constructed of biological
parts.<Delay 20> Do you remember
those mutated humans?<New>
Those are all people who
were destined to become
replacement parts for
Deus."<Close><End of Block>

parts for god..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, almost all the
people are destined to
become parts for Deus.<New>
But you people gathered
here are all different.<New>
You could say...you
escaped that destiny by
existing through multiple
generations...<New>
In actuality, there wasn't
enough parts for Deus...<Delay 20>
But, Krelian compensated
for what was lacking.<New>
The reduction in the number
of parts, was due to humans
living through multiple
generations...<New>
But that deficiency in the
human factor, was made up
for by the nanomachines
created by Krelian.<New>
Not only that, but his
nanomachines added
additional functions.<New>
Deus has thus evolved into
the perfect weapon.<Close><End of Block>

of humans.<New>
When the previous one dies,
somewhere another Miang is
awakened.<New>
It is programmed into all
womens' DNA to be that way.<New>
Who inherits the duty is
just a matter of
probability, Fei.<New>
