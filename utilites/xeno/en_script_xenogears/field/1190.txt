Did you want to
talk to me?"<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"Um...<Delay 5> About my shooting
down the Goliath...<Delay 10> I'm,<Delay 5>
errh,<Delay 5> really,<Delay 5> errh<Delay 5>..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Oh, is that it?
I guess it could not be
helped...<New>
But, jumping the gun is
your bad habit.<Delay 10>
A king should always keep
calm and judge carefully!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:58 h:1>
(Maison says the same thing.)<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:48 h:4>
Bart
"Yeah, I know, I know!<Delay 10>
By the way, I have
something to ask you..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:34 h:3>
Citan
"Oh?<Delay 10>
That is unusual."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"Well, it's about this
warship we're on...<New>
...which is the same type
as the Yggdrasil.<New>
Years ago, my old man told
me it was scrapped because
the peace talks with Kislev
made progress.<New>
So I knew it existed..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:30 h:4>
Citan
"Hmm.<Delay 10>
Then, what is
bothering you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:4>
Bart
"The symbol on the ship...<Delay 10>
It's not our Royal Crest!<Delay 10>
Look at this."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:24 h:2>
Citan
"This is..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:46 h:3>
Bart
"I thought you knew it.<Delay 10>
Whose crest is it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:48 h:3>
Citan
"I am not positive but
it looks like Shevat's."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:36 h:3>
Bart
"Shevat?<Delay 10>
What do you mean?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"The Yggdrasil may not
have been made by your
father.<New>
At that time, much of the
potential technology was
not understood and hence,<Delay 10>
was hidden.<New>
Maybe your father might
have been scared of its
power and so sealed it
away."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"Hmm, I see.<Delay 10>
So this may not have been
ours from the start.<New>
If so, I wanna meet
the guys who made this
amazing baby."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:40 h:4>
Citan
"Actually, they may
be closer to you
than you suspect..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:36 h:3>
Bart
"Huh?<Delay 5>
What did you say?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:42 h:4>
Citan
"Nothing...I was just
wondering if Fei and
Elly are alright."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:44 h:3>
Bart
"...<Delay 10>
Sorry, it's my fault."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:3>
Citan
"N, no,<Delay 10>
I did not mean to...<New>
I am sure<Delay 10> they are fine."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"Though there's no proof to
back it up, I feel better
now that you said that...<New>
Even though I know you're
probably lying through your
teeth to make me feel less
worried..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Anyway, enough worrying...<Delay 10>
But I do think you should
apologize to Rico.<New>
You may get more than a
bruise this time though."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:14 h:2>
Bart
"Yeah."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:36 h:3>
Citan
"Rico was checking
on his Gear."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:40 h:2>
What do you wanna do
with your Gear?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:22 h:1>
Come again.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:54 h:3>
Oh, Bart!
Thank you for letting me
ride on your Yggdrasil!<New>
I've always wanted to ride
it... It's OK. The children
are safe in Nisan's care!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:48 h:3>
I heard there was a
shortage of people so I
decided to participate!<Delay 10><New>
Actually, I got fed up
with my job in the small
hideout...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:40 h:2>
What do you wanna do
with your Gear?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:36 h:2>
You must come back
now, ya hear!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:22 h:1>
Come again!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:44 h:4>
If something should
happen, I'll go too!
That's the spirit of
Yggdrasil Gear troops!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:48 h:4>
I no longer have a place
in Gear combat, but I'd
better be ready for it
anyway!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:52 h:5>
I'll go buy parts for the
Gears.<Delay 10> General Maitreya'll
be upset if we don't try 
to put another Gear unit
together.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:48 h:4>
Hey, you haven't seen
Maria's Gear, have you?<New>
It's too big to fit in
this hangar, so it's on
the deck.<New>
Speaking of which...<New>
Do you wanna change the 
name of <Seibzehn>?
    <Opcode 1 255>Yeah, why not!?
    No, not now...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:36 h:4>
General Maitreya,
Falkon and Farrant
are gone.<Delay 10>
...I miss them.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:42 h:4>
We don't have enough
underwater equipment,
Gears, or pilots.<Delay 10>
I'm glad you're here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:54 h:3>
When I come here at night I
sometimes hear Maitreya and
them talking and laughing.<New>
But when I get closer, the
voices disappear.<Delay 10> I'm sure
they are lonely,<Delay 10> too.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:44 h:4>
Maitreya admired your
dive technique.<Delay 10>
I hear your zoom
technique is flawless.<New>
Do you think you
can train me on
my next watch?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:52 h:3>
Now, I must ready the Gear
parts.<Delay 10> Maitreya's strict
with this sort of thing.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:46 h:3>
That Gear with the
slender build withstood
<Brigandier>'s rod?<New>
What kind of armor did
they use to cover it?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:62 h:4>
Hey? Did you see this month's
edition of "Gear Fan Magazine"?<Delay 10>
They say, 'Hovering' is all
the rage right now'!<New>
Until a while back, it used
to be special equipment that
only the young master had
equipped on his Gear!<Close><End of Block>
