you were in the Gear.<New>
But even if you hadn't,
people would have died...<Delay 10>
Right?<Delay 10>
You weren't the reason.<New>
War...<Delay 10>no, the people

Right now there is no

fight...<Delay 10> But that doesn't

don't you have to fight?"<Close><End of Block>

fight. <New>
But as long as you ignore

never forgive you.<New>
Just remember that."<Close><End of Block>

"And another thing,<New>
I'm not saying that not
helping me is running

You don't have to help.<Delay 10>
This is my own problem.<Delay 10>
I don't wanna get you in

But,<Delay 10> if I had your skill

It's because of the
