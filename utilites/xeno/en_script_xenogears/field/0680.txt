<TextBlock 1 w:44 h:3>
Soon this area will be
totally excavated...<New>
We'll have to find 
another place with 
buried treasure...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:50 h:3>
Running into those army
guys is real dangerous...<New>
If they find new ruins,
they'll take them over
for themselves...<New>
So,<Delay 10> I wonder where
the best place is?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:40 h:3>
Shh!
I'm trying to think.
So, keep it down.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:50 h:4>
Since the army no longer
controls the dig sites,
you can go by yourself...<New>
Now the buying prices at
the 'Ethos' workshop
have gone down.
What should we do?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:52 h:4>
I came here looking for 
fortune...but all the
good sites are controlled
by the military.<New>
I'll have to go home a
failure. What should I do?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:50 h:4>
I wanted to try my luck 
at treasure hunting.<New>
I'm pretty successful.
The reason is I found a
good partner.<New>
Even now he's looking at 
a map, analyzing our next
step. I sure depend on my
pal.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:52 h:8>
   - Come to Dazil! -
 
 If you dig in the ruins, 
   you too can be rich!
