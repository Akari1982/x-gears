...<Delay 10>...<Delay 10><New>
That's not it. This
type...It matches with
the Aveh pirate ship,
Yggdrasil."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:38 h:4>
Dominia
"Yggdrasil?
Wasn't she sunk in 
another battle?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:54 h:4>
"There's no record of
its sinking. We were too
busy fighting that red
Gear to try to confirm it."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:48 h:3>
Dominia
"Then, there is a chance
that it did not sink...<New>
I believe the data shows
the Yggdrasil was the
carrier for that Gear."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:44 h:2>
"One moment<Delay 30>...<Delay 30>...<Delay 30>
Yes, that is correct."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:44 h:3>
Dominia
"Excellent.
Give me the controls."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:48 h:3>
"Excellent?
What are you planning on
doing?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Dominia
"Sink it, of course.
She will never trouble the
Commander again."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:4>
"Wait. The Commander's
orders were to investigate
the disappearance of that
flying battleship. <New>
We can't deviate from 
our mission.<New>
Besides, we are low on
fuel and need to refuel."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:40 h:3>
Dominia
"We have enough.
I'll take her down."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:44 h:4>
"...Groan... Once you
start, there is no
stopping you is there?<New>
I hope you know that
fighting in water is
totally different than
fighting on land."<Close><End of Block>

"Of course. Sorry,
Kelvena."<Close><End of Block>

a tough fight, Bart."<Close><End of Block>

You're alive!?"<Close><End of Block>

What are you doing
here?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:36 h:3>
Elly
"Dominia!?
Why are you here?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:48 h:4>
Dominia
"Why? We Gebler need no
special reasons to sink
an enemy ship!<New>
It is our divine duty to
rule those crass land
dwelling Lambs."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"But why?
How are they different from
us Shepherds, the -Abel- ?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:3>
Dominia
"To me -Lambs- and -Abel-
are the same.<New>
The only definite
differenece is
personal ability.<New>
The ignorant must
be lead by the wise.
That is our job.<New>
Look what you've gained
as an Element, Elly.
Why do you even question?<New>
Your superiority
is obvious!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:46 h:4>
Elly
"...So the wise harming
the weak is a sign of
ability?<New>
I didn't want that...<Delay 30>
That's all!!"<Close><End of Block>

"Elly,
are you alright?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:46 h:4>
Dominia
"That Gear, you're the
one? Hah! So that's how
it is.<New>
How amusing, Elhaym.
All this for a man?
I guess that story was
true after all.<New>
You were born of those
lowly Lambs."<Close><End of Block>

Don't say another word!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:50 h:3>

"Hmph, what are you going
to do about it, mongrel!?<New>
Are you going to use the
power you used in that
incident on me now?<New>
Go ahead. Show me.
Show me your true power!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:30 h:4>
Elly
"...I will.<New>
If you Gebler
are wise...<Delay 20>
then <Delay 30>I'd rather
be a fool!!"<Close><End of Block>

"Then so be it. Then you
shall be dealt with as
the traitor you are."<Close><Close><End of Block>
