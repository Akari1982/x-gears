It<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>seems like<Delay 8>
we've drifted
further off.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:50 h:2>
<Delay 3>...<Delay 5>Constantly<Delay 5> drifting<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Sounds like me right now.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:34 h:1>
What do you mean?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:46 h:3>
I've just been <Delay 3>drifting
around...being lead by
circumstances.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:36 h:4>
No<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>
that's not right.<New>
In Aveh,<Delay 3>
you helped Bart
when he needed it.<New>
And in Kislev,<Delay 3>
you gave your all
to defend,<Delay 8> to
save everyone.<New>
You've even shown
concern<Delay 3> for me
many times.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:34 h:2>
No<Delay 3>...<Delay 8>
I'm <Delay 3>just no good.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:8 h:1>
Why?<Delay 3><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Probably deep inside,
I'm not really trying
to help.<New>
Somehow, I get the
feeling that all I've
done I did because I
wanted to be needed.<New>
That if I did something
for them<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>then maybe,
<Delay 3>I'd <Delay 3>have a
place to belong<Delay 3>...<New>
There's a side of me that
comforts itself like that.<New>
That doesn't mean I don't
want to help.<Delay 8> But, <Delay 3>that
doesn't mean I really want
to help either.<New>
It might not be 'nothing',
but it sure isn't the
'whole' either.<New>
I'd been drifting, led
around until I met you,
Elly.<New>
Now, we're stranded out
in the ocean.<New>
I'm sorry<Delay 3>...<Delay 8>I got
you involved.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:46 h:5>
It's okay.<Delay 3>
Don't worry about me.<New>
I've been thinking<Delay 3>
why I'm here.<Delay 3><New>
I could've just
gone back.<Delay 3>
But for some reason<Delay 3>
I didn't...<New>
Probably because
you said it's better
to do something
than nothing.<New>
I think that's why
I felt I had to do
something.<New>
It's OK not to
feel 'whole'.<Delay 3><New>
Even if you only feel
partly complete, if
you repeat that enough,
eventually it'll be
'whole'.<New>
A part<Delay 3>...<Delay 3>
is better than
zero.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:30 h:2>
You're right<Delay 3>...<Delay 8>
I'm sorry<Delay 3>...<Close><End of Block>

will you go back?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"I probably won't go back
to my squad.<New>
Right now, I really don't
want to be there<Delay 5>...<New>
Besides,<Delay 3> I could probably
do something else...<Delay 5>
I don't have to be in the
army.<New>
So, I'm thinking of going
back to my country."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:50 h:3>
Fei
"Is that possible?
But what about the army?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:48 h:3>
Elly
"It's not like anyone
knows what I did.<New>
They've probably already
classified me as MIA."<Close><End of Block>

"Hmm.
I hope at least
you'll survive.<New>
I'm sure you'll
find what you
want to do in
your life."<Close><End of Block>

something about...
being<Delay 20> comforted."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Don't be too hard on
yourself.<Delay 5> Everyone wants
to be needed at times.<New>
All of us want to give
something inside ourselves
to others to be accepted.<New>
...<Delay 10>Even me.<Delay 10>
Remember how you forced
yourself to eat those
emergency rations?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:22 h:1>
UUUURRRGHH!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:42 h:2>
Elly
"Hey...<Delay 10>are you okay?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:44 h:4>
Elly
"I told you not to eat
such a gross looking
animal."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:4>
Fei
"It tastes horrible. The
last time I had food this
bad was doc's cooking."<Close><End of Block>

something we're
going to die."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"I guess there's no other
way. I was hoping to save
this a little longer..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:54 h:3>
Elly
"This should hold us
for another day...<New>
But it's only for emergency
calories so I can't promise
how good it'll taste."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"Huh!?<Delay 10>
What?<Delay 10>
It's dry and crumbly?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:36 h:4>
Elly
"I thought so...
You don't like it,
do you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:42 h:4>
Fei
"Wha? N, no...<Delay 10>
It's good.
Yeah, ah, it's great.<New>
Whatever you'd share
with me couldn't be
that bad, could it?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"You forced yourself to
eat those rations earlier,
didn't you?<New>
For me to survive, it
would have been better
not to share it.<New>
But, watching you eat it
even though it tasted bad
comforted me.<New>
I felt glad that I shared
it with you... It made me
feel a little better."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:40 h:2>
Fei
"For your own sake?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"Yes,<Delay 5> for my own sake.<Delay 10>
Selfish, I admit.<New>
But, I think it's okay to
be that way at first.<New>
But little by little you
learn about your own
happiness...<New>
And someday you are able to
share that important part
of you with someone else.
Some...<Delay 20>day."<Close><End of Block>

What's up?"<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"...Nothing. It just felt
as though I've told you
the same thing long ago...<New>
It must be my imagination.
I couldn't have said it to
you before, because we've
only just met, haven't we?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:46 h:3>

just my imagination<Delay 10>..."<Close><End of Block>

Wake up!"<Close><End of Block>
