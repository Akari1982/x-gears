Ah, Bartholomew. <Delay 10>
"The Gear are all aboard 
the Yggdrasil."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:52 h:4>
Good work. <Delay 10>
Without your backup, this 
base wouldn't be here. 
Let's board the Yggdrasil.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:30 h:1>
Thank you sir!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:50 h:4>
This Gear is called
<Heimdal>. It was
excavated together
with <Brigandier>.<New>
But we could never get it
to run very well. Three
test pilots were injured
in trying. <New>
I guess no one can
tame it.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:60 h:2>
<Brigandier> is a star
of hope for us pirates.<New>
The bright red body-color
represents Bart's ambition.<New>
But since Bart always overdoes
things, maintenance is a pain.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:68 h:3>
This is a mass produced model
based on Bart's <Brigandier>,
that's simplified to reduce costs.<New>
If you tune them up they're
pretty good.<Delay 10> That's when we 
can really show our skills.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:44 h:3>
No, the specs on this
Gear are unknown...<Delay 10><New>
And this kind of stuff
isn't anything I can
understand.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:54 h:4>
Looks like someone really
knew how to tune up your
Gear...<New>
Attack,<Delay 10> defense,<Delay 10> 
Ether amplification...<Delay 10> 
an exceptionally balanced
machine.<New>
But we don't seem to be
able to dismantle some
parts to see what they
do...<New>
I guess you could call
them<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>black boxes.<New>
There are quite a number
of them on this machine<Delay 5>...<Delay 10> 
Do you have any idea what
they actually do?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:14 h:2>
Fei
"<Opcode 14 2>No..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:44 h:3>
This is your Gear,
right?<Delay 10> This one's
worth tinkering with!<New>
It makes use of some
incredible technology.<New>
I'm gonna look over it
a bit, so can you come
back later?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:44 h:4>
Finally all the Gears
are on board the
Yggdrasil.<Delay 10>
Yours is on board too.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:48 h:4>
Boss, let us mess with 
the Gears a little...
Craftsmen have to keep
practicing their skills!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:32 h:2>
I'm going to the
next hangar.<Close><End of Block>

He'll be okay.<New>
It may not even be

Don't know how we could

But like he said, that's
just running away. <Delay 10>
I must find my own path.<Delay 10>
Right, doc?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:52 h:4>
Fei
"If Bart wishes, I'll 
cooperate with you guys.<Delay 10>
That's all I can do now.<New>
But I think I'll find
the path I should follow
as I help others like you.<New>
Moreover, I can't turn my
back and ignore what such

are doing to others."<Close><End of Block>
