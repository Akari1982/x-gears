how would you know that?<New>
Not even the government

Elly
"Come to think of it, it
seems like we took the long
way here on purpose.<New>
There must've been a faster
way to Bart and them.<New>
Also, the route to get to
this block can't even be
downloaded on the map.<New>
So how did we know what
streets we were on?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:48 h:3>
Elly
"That's impossible.<New>
First of all, that
partition we took to get
into this block.<New>
That panel was displayed
to be a P4 facility.<New>
Even a high ranking
officer of Solaris
can't get in here.<New>
You think they'd
leave a facility like
that unlocked and open?"<Close><End of Block>

Who exactly are you?"<Close><End of Block>

You were able to get into
Solaris under martial law,<New>
sneak into the palace, get
through a P4 level door,<New>

of the P4 facility...<Delay 30>
How is that possible?"<Close><End of Block>

didn't know the motive

You know even more details

"Yes...<Delay 30>10,000 years ago.
Beings called humans were

"Now only the Emperor is
left. His destiny is to
never die.<New>
However, the Ministry is
different.<New>
Once, during the
Diabolos Invasion...<Delay 30>
the Ministry elders died
losing their bodies.<New>
Now, the Solaris governing
Ministry exists as data in
memory banks.<New>
Each of their personalities
are bits of data."<Close><End of Block>

souls they are just binary

Citan
"After the Fall, wanting
to resurrect their bodies,
and create a worthy vessel,<New>
they transferred a research
facility that was once the
Soylent System on the land
to Etrenank.<New>
Eventually the facility was
no longer only for the
Emperor's life and the
Ministry's resurrection,<New>
but it began producing food
and drugs with additives
that controlled the public.<New>
The memory cube Fei and
them were using was meant
for obtaining living data.<New>
Of course, the 'Ethos' also
sent various data to help."<Close><End of Block>
