Those self-detonating
bombs are just air units
with Kief class bombs
on board.<New>
I don't see why they
need to use them all of
a sudden...<New>
There are just too many.
One of those alone would
have enough firepower,
but 8 of them is overkill.<New>
They haven't told us our
target yet, and we're not
just going to drop them
for fun.<New>
You bet I'm worried."<Close><End of Block>

I can understand us having

You're a pure 1st Class
