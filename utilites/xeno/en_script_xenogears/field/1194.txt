The source of our Ether

It all comes from the

which can control any
potential phenomena.<New>
If we destroy it,<Delay 5>
Deus...<Delay 5>

<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:4>

The observer's perception

In other words, I believe

"Yes. That is why Merkava
is being used to begin the
destruction.<New>
But...Deus is not
following its programming
of exterminating all of
civilization...<New>
The -Seraphs-, which are
terminal interface weapons
of Deus, are using their
bodies composed of...<New>
...nanomachines to absorb
massive numbers of people
regardless of whether
they are dead or alive.<New>
It is not discriminating
between the mutant and 
non-mutant people. This
is highly peculiar...<New>
...The fact that the
people who are meant to
be destroyed are being
taken in as well...<New>
That is the absolute
opposite of what it is

Aside from those bodies
that were destined to be
parts for it...<New>
...Deus, who has already
acquired the abilities of
the nanomachines, can just
about use any material...<New>

It is obvious, it has other

Krelian has called Deus

That is its motive. Such a

<TextBlock 33 w:56 h:7>
Merkava's main gun requires
a 1.2 second interval to
reload because of its
tremendous output.<New>
Upon firing, although it
is only sectional, there
will be a portion of the
barrier that will be opened.<New>
There is a 1.87 second
delay before the barrier
reforms in that area. If
we can use this window of
time to target and destroy
that cannon, it will be
possible to close in on it.<New>
If we can get close enough,
we can break through with
gravitational-spatial
correction.<Close><End of Block>

we just need to shut that

"No, listen. We're not
going to just rush in.<New>
The Yggdrasil IV and
this Excalibur are also
equipped with barriers.
That's what we'll use.<New>
Although only for a short
time, we can withstand a
direct hit from Merkava's
main cannon.<New>
Then we can close in and
watch for that part of the
barrier to go down and
then destroy the cannon."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 42 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"That's all? It wouldn't
matter how fast we fly.<New>
In that amount of time,
we'll be without a barrier
before we can get within
firing range.<New>
And those numbers are valid
only if the generator is at
full drive, right?<New>
You can only get those
numbers if we sacrifice
all other output and
propulsion."<Close><End of Block>

The Yggdrasil IV or

At least with one
generator that is..."<Close><End of Block>

"Meaning...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:54 h:4>

"Meaning, we can defend

twice the amount of time...<New>

the 2 generators together.
This way, we can make it
into the heart of Merkava."<Close><End of Block>

propulsion..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:38 h:2>
Bart
"Just hear me out."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:62 h:5>
This is what we do...
First we transform my Yggdrasil
into heavy assault mode and
load it onto the Excalibur so
we can couple the generators.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:52 h:5>
By doing that, we can
reduce the energy usage
down to just supporting
the hull of the ship and
generating the barrier.<New>
This will allow most of
the energy to be devoted
to generating the barrier.<New>
Next, shift the barrier to
full front and focus it to
a single point where their
main cannon will make its
strike.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:54 h:5>
Now for movement.
First off, we develop
a barrier by engaging
Excalibur's generator
to maximum power.<New>
For propulsion during that
time, we'll install on the
Yggdrasil those large solid
rockets we got from the
ruins of the Mass-driver.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:48 h:4>
When Excalibur's barrier
expires, we'll use the
Yggdrasil IV's generator
to develop a barrier.<New>
Then we'll also detach
the solid rockets and
shift the Excalibur into
conventional flight.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:50 h:4>
Using this method, we can
get right in Merkava's
face. After it fires,
it'll be defenseless.<New>
During this time, we'll
block the muzzle of
Merkava's cannon with
Excalibur's bow ram.<New>
Upon which, we should
have 0.67 seconds...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:56 h:6>
With the cannon fire of the
Excalibur, we'll destroy the
Yggdrasil IV's slave
generator and incapacitate
the Merkava along the way,
and then...we breakthrough!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:50 h:4>
Bart
"...That's what the plan
is all about.<New>
The combination of the
barriers of both ships...
Storming the Merkava...<New>
The timing of the cannon
fire of the Excalibur...
These are all going to
be crucial.<New>
Mess up any one of these
and the consequences are
going to be severe.<New>
Hence, it'll be necessary
to have both crews in
synch with each other.<New>
That's why I'd like to
place Sig in command of
the Excalibur."<Close><End of Block>

power before our arrival."<Close><End of Block>
