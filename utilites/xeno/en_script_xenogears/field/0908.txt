been taken back from
Shakhan and Gebler.<New>
Thank you.<New>
Now, in order to free
other lands from
Gebler and Solaris...<New>
...we must destroy the
other two gates and
bring down Solaris.<New>
We've learned from
Shakhan's notes that the
gates form the points 
of a triangle."<Close><End of Block>

One point was the Great
Mausoleum. <Delay 50>
Two others remain, but we

headquarters. However..."<Close><End of Block>

"It wasn't there when we
followed Stone under
the 'Ethos' headquarters.<New>
If it really is there...<Delay 30>
it must be buried deep
beneath the earth..."<Close><End of Block>

destroy it then?"<Close><End of Block>

have tried it already."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"...Oh..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:48 h:4>
Citan

Shevat's cannon."<Close><End of Block>

ever produced by man..."<Close><End of Block>

Yeah! I got it!<New>
Ft. Jasper!

What about that?"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"However powerful the Jasper
may be, how are we going to
aim it at the 'Ethos' H.Q.?<New>
To damage something that
deep underground we would
have to attack it from

But the Jasper gun is..."<Close><End of Block>

should just move Ft.
Jasper on top of Babel?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:50 h:4>

"Now that you mention it,
Babel does overlook their
headquarters.<New>
If we shoot it from there
it might just possibly be
able to reach that far
underground."<Close><End of Block>

"But how could we move
Ft. Jasper?"<Close><End of Block>

I think it moved the

A giant mirror and a giant

something in this..."<Close><End of Block>

I have solved
the puzzle..."<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 38 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"The Babel and Jasper
ruins are from the same
civilzation.<New>
One far more advanced
than our own...
Do not the two structures
seem similar to you?<New>
I believe they were both
built with Gears and a
powerful foe in mind."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:48 h:3>
Fei
"Yeah, I noticed that. 
But what's it all mean?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"It means, the people
who built the giant
mirror at Babel Tower...<New>
...knew about the giant
gun at Jasper!"<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"And...?<Delay 30>
What are you
getting at?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"We can probably assume
the mirror was built to
reflect something...<New>
That something being a
beam. A beam shot from
the Jasper gun!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:48 h:4>
Fei
"Reflect?<Delay 30>
You mean that mirror can
reflect a beam attack?"<Close><End of Block>

"Yes."<Close><End of Block>

Rico
"Long ago Babel and
Jasper must have
been at war."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:48 h:3>
Citan
"Not exactly.<New>
The Babel mirror and
Jasper gun were combined
to make one weapon."<Close><End of Block>

Rico
"Whaddya mean?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:50 h:4>
Elly
"But those things are so
far apart, how could they
be one weapon?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Well the gates may be
far apart, but aren't
they still one device?"<Close><End of Block>

"Yes, I see what
you mean but..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:36 h:3>

that weapon for?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:44 h:2>
Citan
"That, I do not know."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:46 h:4>
Bart
"Whatever. The point is
how do we use the
two weapons as one?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:46 h:3>
Citan
"Aim the Jasper gun at
the mirror and fire.<New>
The mirror will reflect
the beam on the gate."<Close><End of Block>

work?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 57 w:42 h:4>
Citan
"Theoretically.
It will require a few
minor adjustments..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 58 w:46 h:4>
Sigurd
"Adjusting the mirror
is going to be rather
difficult and tedious."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 59 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"If the two weapons are
one, then it should not
be too difficult.<New>
I hope..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 60 w:46 h:3>
Rico
"It sounds dangerous.<New>
I think it was meant to
reflect shots back at
the enemy.<New>
If you're wrong it'll
come back and hit you."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 61 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Yes. That is why it is
most difficult for the
gun crew.<New>
The mirror must be hit
precisely."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 62 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"We will need to divide
into two teams.
One will fire the gun...<New>
While the other will adjust
the angle of the mirror to
ensure the beam hits the
'Ethos' headquarters.<New>
Since this was my idea,
I will take the dangerous
part of adjusting the
mirror."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 63 w:42 h:4>

"Alright Hyuga, we'll
let you take care of
that...<New>
...It seems like
your type of job."<Close><End of Block>

"I'll go too.
Doc might need help."<Close><End of Block>

just Citan and Fei.
So I had better go too."<Close><End of Block>

"Alright, you three take
Babel. Now what about
the gun?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 67 w:50 h:3>

my kind of job.<New>
Don't worry, I won't
miss. I haven't been
using a gun for nothing."<Close><End of Block>

go to the Jasper."<Close><End of Block>

You go with Citan to aim
the mirror at the 'Ethos'
