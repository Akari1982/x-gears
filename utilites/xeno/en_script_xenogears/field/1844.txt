Driving back the Solarian
interceptor forces, we
took to the floating
continent, Mahanon.
 
It was the central hull
of a colossal spacecraft
with a diameter of at
least 40 kelts.
 
Judging from the condition
of the hull, we estimated
the ship was thousands of
years old.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:60 h:23>
"Alien beings that came
to our planet from a far
off galaxy, aeons ago<Delay 5>..."
 
Could it possibly have been
that our ancestors were the
passengers of this ship and
had crash landed here on
this planet<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
 
It was determined, by
examining the inside
of the wreckage, that
some kind of accident
occured on this ship
about 10,000 years ago
...which forced it to
crash onto our planet.
 
Seeking god and his divine
wisdom...'Razael's Tree'...
which, it is said, lie here in
Mahanon, we proceeded further.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:44 h:19>
In the depths we saw
an alien form. It was
partially rotted and
petrified, a giant
grotesque being<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
 
'It' gave off an
inexplicable air of
intimidation.
 
Perhaps it was more
than a gut reaction.
Perhaps it was the
fear of the 'Absolute'
that came from the
very depths of our
inherited instincts...
And then<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
'It' attacked us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:46 h:14>
The partially rotted
thing eventually
disintegrated.
 
We proceeded even
further leaving
that area behind<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
 
We came to an enormous
cavern that was big
enough to swallow the
whole capital of Aveh.
In its center were two
gently glowing objects.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:52 h:12>
It was the source
of divine wisdom<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
It was <Delay 10>'Razael's Tree'.
 
And the cavern itself
was the giant computer
called Razael.
 
The wisdom of god,
hidden within Razael...
We found the unthinkable
when we accessed its data.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:54 h:7>
A large unmanned strategic
weapon and its battalion of
terminal interface weapons,
travelling from star system
to star system.
And a gargantuan mothership
used to carry them...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:56 h:12>
These weapons were called,<Delay 60>
'Yabeh',<Delay 5> the inter-planetary
strategic weapon system.
 
The construction of god's
ark... The army with which
to reign over the vast
universe... The creation of
the angel 'Malakh'...
 
What the Gazel Ministry was
looking for was right here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:54 h:4>
According to the data, the
giant, rotting organism we
just defeated was in fact
the nucleus of this system.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:58 h:12>
We were on the verge of
accessing the data for
the object called...
 
        'Zohar'

the entire system, from the
weapons to the mothership...
 
When suddenly, 'HE' appeared.<Close><End of Block>
