"Because of what I found
out, I came down to the
surface world...<New>
And this is where I hid,
along with my wife,
Racquel, and son Billy.<New>
I've been looking for
that Gear and the girl
ever since."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 131 w:52 h:4>
Jessie
"Finally,<Delay 10> I found out that
the scientist's daughter
and Gear may be in Shevat.<New>
All very well, except now
I don't know how in blazes
to get there, or even how
to contact the place.<New>
Well, Shevat is protected
by a strong barrier that
even Solaris can't do
anything about...<New>
So I guess you can say
it can't be helped...<Delay 10>
It's just my luck!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 132 w:32 h:3>
That girl's name
wouldn't happen
to be Maria...?<Close><End of Block>

"Oh, are you two alright?<Delay 10>
Shouldn't you get some
more rest...?"<Close><End of Block>

"Yes, I can stand and
can even walk now...
Thank you."<Close><End of Block>

"Maria, eh...?<Delay 10> Hmm...<Delay 10>
If I remember right, her
father's name was Nikolai?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 137 w:52 h:4>
Shevat Agent
"I don't know that much...<Delay 10>
But I have heard rumors
about a girl and a Gear."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 138 w:52 h:4>
Jessie
"Hmm,<Delay 10> it's got to be them.<Delay 10>
So that huge Gear is in
Shevat then!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 139 w:52 h:4>
Jessie
"So then...<Delay 10> how can we get
to this Shevat? Is there a
way to contact the place?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 140 w:54 h:4>
Shevat Agent 
"Unfortunately since I was
taken captive I have no way
of contacting them either."<Close><End of Block>

Shevat Agent
"There just may be a way...!
Originally, Shevat was
situated on top of
Babel Tower.<New>
They say there is a
communication facility to
contact Shevat's native
country on top of the tower.<Delay 10> 
If only it still exists..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 144 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Hmm...<New>
There is a good
possibility the
facility may have
been destroyed...<New>
Especially when you
consider the fact
that the tower was
sealed by the 'Ethos'."<Close><End of Block>

pessimistic again..."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"I guess we have no choice
but try and go there.<New>
As long as the gate exists,
we can't escape from
Solaris' influence anyway.<New>
In other words, even if we
recover Aveh from Shakhan,
it wouldn't immediatley be
a happy ending."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 149 w:42 h:4>
Billy
"I think we have no
choice but to try
and go there...<New>
Either way, as long

can't escape from the
shadow of Solaris."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 150 w:46 h:3>
Citan
"Their 'secret plan' 
bothers me, too...<New>
The real secret is that
they are using humans
gathered from earth..."<Close><End of Block>

"But I don't quite get this<Delay 5>
secret plan<Delay 5> and <Delay 5>the 'Ethos'
involvement<Delay 5> and so on...<New>
What in the hell does
Solaris think us surface
dwelling humans are!?"<Close><End of Block>

I totally forgot that it
was your country..."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"What my country's doing...<Delay 10>
has nothing to do with me.<New>
I myself thought something
was wrong there, and that's
why I came here...<Delay 10>
So, don't worry about me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 154 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"We've got nothing to lose,
so let's try to go there.<New>
We need to find the truth
about those documents found
in the 'Ethos' H.Q. and
what Billy's father said.<New>
And I must go to Shevat
too for my own personal
reasons anyway."<Close><End of Block>
