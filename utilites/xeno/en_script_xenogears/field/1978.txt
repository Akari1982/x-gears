There may be a few things
we can do.<New>
But I've been a soldier
all my life.<New>
I can't sit still as
long as there are
people to protect and
enemies to fight.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:54 h:5>
...It's a different system
from what humans have been
creating. In other words,
it should be called a
machine made by non-humans.<Opcode 2 60><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:52 h:4>
It wasn't made by humans.
That I can see. But what I
want to know is if it's a
machine to begin with.<Opcode 2 60><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:52 h:5>
It doesn't matter whether
it's a machine or a
creature. Nothing can't be
broken. The question is
how we can damage it.<Opcode 2 60><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:38 h:4>
Be quiet!<Delay 30>
Sister!<Delay 30>
Please take the
children elsewhere.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:54 h:4>
You want the children to
stand in the cold hallway!?<Delay 50>
This is the warmest room.
Why can't they stay here?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:44 h:3>
We're having a very
important meeting.
They're disturbing us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Please don't get so upset.<Delay 50>
I really appreciate that
you're trying to protect
us.<New>
But you know those people
are the only ones who can 
change our fate...<Delay 50>
don't you?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:54 h:2>
Really, how can we fight
against an enemy like that?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:56 h:4>
You think it's just going to
sit there while we gather
all of Aveh's and Kislev's
armies...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:46 h:2>
I'm prepared to protect
everyone here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:44 h:3>
I want to help people.
But all I know how to
do is fight.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:54 h:3>
I had doubts about fighting
before, but not about
protecting the people here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:50 h:1>
If we had more weapons...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:48 h:1>
We gotta do what we can.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:52 h:3>
The children are annoying,
but, they're the reason
why I'm here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:52 h:2>
Kids are all the same
in Kislev, Aveh and Nisan.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:44 h:3>
We both no longer have
anything to lose.<New>
Do as you wish.<Delay 60>
I hope you'll have
help from heaven.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:50 h:3>
Now more than ever I feel
as if each child is very
important.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:4>
This is the first time
I've seen snow.<New>
It's so light and white,
and a beautiful pattern
appears for an instant
then it melts on my palm.<New>
It's amazing...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:1>
I wanna see my mom and dad.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:36 h:2>
What is it?
Can I do that too?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:44 h:2>
Her outfit is so cute,
isn't it?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:48 h:3>
My grandma made this for
my mom when she was a
child. It's really warm.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:46 h:3>
Good luck to you too.<Delay 30>
I...<Delay 10>will protect these
people, so don't worry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:38 h:2>
Uh...<Delay 30>I'll play with
the sister.<Delay 30><Close><End of Block>
