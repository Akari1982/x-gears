We must rewrite all
false history books
on the monarchy.<New>
We also must get rid
of any books that
might cause problems.<Close><End of Block>

But now, any pre-Shakhan
records are getting dated.
Strange how the present
becomes the past.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:48 h:3>
I am rearranging all the
records that were hidden
from Shakhan.<New>
I was told to burn them,
but I hid them instead.<Close><End of Block>

This city was built on a
desert rockbed. This was
partially to escape sand
erosion, but that's not
all.<New>
An underground water basin
wells up here. The rockbed
is made of limestone, so
the water level continued
to rise to its present level.<New>
Fatima Castle was originally
built to protect the water
source, but gradually the
desert people started to
live here.<New>
They were soon joined by a
steady flow of people from
the northern lands.
That is the story of this
city, Bledavik.<Close><End of Block>

'Aveh's True History'<New>
...In the dark days of the
Fatima rule, the people had
little to eat and even less
to be happy about.<New>
Their hardships peaked during
the reign of Edbart IV...<New>
Using the people's fury as
his power base, Shakhan, the
Prime Minister then, lead
the armies that broke the
tyrany of the Fatima dynasty.<New>
Those heroes became the 
nucleus of Aveh's current
armed forces...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:62 h:4>
It is said the founder of Aveh,
one Roni Fatima, was part of a
desert caravan, but he probably
also had other sides to him.<New>
The myths speak of the
involvement of giants in
battles that were part of
a massive power struggle.<New>
Almost all the records from
that time have been lost, and
what little remains is doubted
as being historically correct.<New>
But then Roni Fatima could have
been behind altering things.<Close><End of Block>
