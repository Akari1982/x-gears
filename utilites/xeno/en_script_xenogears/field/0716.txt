I never intended to destroy

Even if that were

There!<Delay 10>
That was the catalyst for

"Who cares why!
It does not matter how
many of them died...<New>
They were wretched vermin,
only living from day to day

their prescribed destinies!<New>
And have you forgotten?<Delay 10>
You were the one who
destroyed the village.<Delay 10>
I did not lift a finger."<Close><End of Block>

"What will you do, Fei?
If you die here, then
so be it.<New>
You may indeed gain some
happiness from not knowing.
But surely, that is not
what you truly want...?<New>
If you want to know the
truth...and that is what
you want, isn't it Fei...
then this is what to do...<New>
You must show me that you
have attained the level of
strength I require...<New>
To do that you must destroy
others by using your own
strength!<New>
Then you will gain all
that was lost in exchange
for that scream of death!<Delay 15>
