"What're you going to do
to me...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:40 h:2>
As I suspected.
You know nothing...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:38 h:3>
Fei
"Doc!! <Delay 10>Citan,
why are you here!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:44 h:4>
Citan
"I saw Bart's image on
the Birdvision in the
dedication."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:48 h:2>
Fei
"You saw that too, doc?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Yes.<Delay 10> But I did not
see either of you.<New>
Soon after, I heard
there was an intruder
at the 2nd floor of
the Arebato Grounds.<New>
I suspected
it was probably you
so I waited here.<New>
After that,
I did not hear anything
about the capture of
any intruders."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:46 h:3>
Fei
"How did you know I was
going to be here?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"The best possible way to
sneak into the Palace
is through the dust chute.<New>
And to get back to
the 3rd floor, one must
pass through this
observation tower.<New>
I have always
been thinking<Delay 5>...<Delay 5><New>
Do you think you could
possibly be a little more
subtle?<New>
When infiltrating
enemy ground, the most
basic thing to do is to
be stealthy.<New>
With the amount of
activity you have stirred
up, you could even wake
up the dead."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:46 h:3>
Fei
"Well, I was actually
trying to be subtle..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:44 h:4>
Citan
"By the way, what
happened to Elly?<Delay 10>
Was she not with you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:50 h:3>
Fei
"Elly...<Delay 10> She went back
home.<New>
She really shouldn't have
any relation with us land
dwellers.<New>
She already has such
wonderful parents..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:42 h:4>
Citan
"I see...<Delay 10><New>
Yes. It may have been
better for her that
way. Let us head for
the dust chute then."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:10 h:1>
Yeah!<Opcode 2 30><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:50 h:3>
Citan
"Now Fei,<Delay 10> stay very close
to me.<New>
That way it does not pick
up on your presence."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:4 h:1>
?<Delay 5>?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:46 h:4>
Fei
"Doc, hold on. 
How can you get 
past here?<New>
According to Elly, only
1st Class citizens
and military personnel
can pass through...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:54 h:3>
Citan
"Uh!?<Delay 20> Well<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>that is...<New>
P,<Delay 10> probably they have not
deleted my ID from the days
I was in the military <New>
and it is still stored
in the data bank."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:44 h:3>
My, how the Solaris
monitors are sloppy...<Delay 10>
Hahaha...<Close><End of Block>
