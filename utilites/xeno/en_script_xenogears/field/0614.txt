The remote village of Lahan,
 in the outskirts of Aveh,
near the border with Kislev.<Opcode 2 160><Close><End of Block>

This is where it all begins.<Opcode 2 150><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:68 h:12>
The continent of Ignas, in the
northern hemisphere of our world.<Delay 30>
On this, the largest continent,
a war has been raging between two
countries for hundreds of years.<Delay 30>
In the north of the continent lies
the Kislev Empire, in the south
lies the desert kingdom of Aveh.<Delay 30>
The war has gone on for so long
that the people have forgotten the
cause, knowing only the pointless
circle of hostility and tragedy.<Delay 200><Delay 200><Delay 200><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:68 h:11>
The chronic war obsession was soon
to encounter a devastating change.<Delay 30>
This was due to the 'Ethos',<Delay 10> an
institution that preserves our
world's culture,<Delay 10> repairing tools
and weapons excavated from the
ruins of an ancient civilization.<Delay 30>
At once both countries excavated
these ruins, and had the 'Ethos'
repair the discoveries, in order
to increase their military power.<Delay 200><Delay 220><Delay 220><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:68 h:10>
The various weapons excavated from
the ruins greatly changed the form
of warfare.<Delay 30>
The outcome of the battles between
the two countries was no longer
determined by man-to-man combat,
but by 'Gears'<Delay 10> - giant humanoid
fighting machines -<Delay 10> that were
obtained from deep within the
ruins.<Delay 200><Delay 200><Delay 200><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:68 h:11>
Eventually,<Delay 10> after continuous
swings in the state of the war,<Delay 10>
Kislev gained the upper hand.<Delay 30>
The major factor behind this lay
in the enormous difference in the
amount of resources buried within
their ruins.<Delay 30>
But suddenly a mysterious military
force appeared in the continent of
Ignas.<Delay 20> Called 'Gebler', this force
decided to make contact with Aveh.<Delay 200><Delay 200><Delay 200><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:68 h:11>
With the assistance of this Gebler
military force,<Delay 5> Aveh was able to
recover from being hopelessly out-
numbered to being back on an even
standing with Kislev.<Delay 30>
Then,<Delay 10> taking further advantage of
its newly gained momentum,<Delay 10> Aveh
started to capture one territory
after another from Kislev,<Delay 10> showing
no indication of slowing down in
their invasion campaign.<Delay 200><Delay 220><Delay 220><Close><End of Block>
