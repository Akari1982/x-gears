We have the coordinates

N24, E92, Ignas, in the
Lahan region, the

From the wave pattern,
it's definitely a Gatekeeper.<Close><End of Block>

No. The mass is

I won't allow them

"Wait. Their mother ship
Yggdrasil seems to be
able to submerge.<New>
If they submerge,
they'll have the upper
hand on Haishao.<New>
Any attack we might make
would just be wasted
since they could
simply dive.<New>
But if we eliminate that
function first, it's
still not too late.<New>
I've already made the
proper 'arrangements'."<Close><End of Block>
