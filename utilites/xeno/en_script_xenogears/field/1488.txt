Want to hear
an interesting story?<New>
Let's see...<Delay 20>
How about the cursed
secret of
<Seibzehn>?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:50 h:7>
For the past several
decades, our scientists
had put so much effort
into the research to
create evolved Gears.<New>
Regardless of how great a
pilot one is, as long it
is human, there will
always exist a time lag
and human error when
interfacing with a
machine.<New>
That's when your father,
Nikolai was targeted.<Delay 20>
He was a genius in the
field of cranial nerve
mechanisms.<New>
They made Nikolai search
for a way for humans to
go beyond humans...<Delay 20> By
merging humans and
machines.<New>
In other words, they were
trying to create a new
life, an ultimate living
weapon,<Delay 10> by connecting a
living human brain to a
Gear directly.<New>
It would've stayed as a
mere fantasy<Delay 10> without
Nikolai.<Delay 20> But that genius
made the fantasy come
true...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:52 h:7>
As a matter of fact,
various data and
components obtained from
the war in Ignas, and the
Battling in Kislev, were
used as experimental
materials.<New>
That is how the special
humanoid mutants, Wels
were born.<Delay 20> Wels created
in Solaris were tested
on the surface.<New>
Only the Wels that passed
the tests were dismantled,
restructured, and reborn.<Delay 20>
They became the Gear's
central control circuit...
and became part of the
machine...<New>
It's all the result of
your father's great
research.<Delay 20>
<Seibzehn>, is the
prototype of 
a man-machine fusion
Gear.<New>
In other words...
<Seibzehn> was completed
at the cost of innumerable
land dwellers' lives.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:48 h:2>
And in the nerve circuit
of <Seibzehn> lies...<Close><End of Block>

You should be well aware

At the research
institute in Solaris..."<Close><End of Block>

"I just turned five years
old at that time, and had
no clue what was happening.<New>
Using me as a hostage,
they forced my father to
continue the research..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:48 h:4>
Maria
"But he never showed his
pain or sorrow in front
of me...<New>
He always smiled

 <Seibzehn> will be
 by your side to
 protect you...' "<Close><End of Block>

Now, the only connection

is this <Seibzehn>..."<Close><End of Block>

"But...I'll save my

Maria and you're with us,

together, we can teach
Solaris a thing or two!<Close><End of Block>

ending his life like
that...<Close><End of Block>

But, this is such a
