we'd be...<Delay 20>enemies."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"But, there's no reason for
you to do this to yourself
just so you can fight.<New>
There's no reason for you

None at all."<Close><End of Block>

the 'Drive'?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"I didn't want to...
When I use it, I change.<New>
I feel like I'm dominated
by some unknown power
that I never wanted...<New>
There's a power in me I
don't want to admit.<New>
But...<Delay 20>I want to
protect my allies...
So, I had no choice but to
use...<Delay 20>the 'Drive'."<Close><End of Block>

Probably because our
problems were so similar."<Close><End of Block>

I'm not being fair,
am I...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"No, I'm just
pessimistic
sometimes.<New>
But...<Delay 20>even so, it's
better than worrying
