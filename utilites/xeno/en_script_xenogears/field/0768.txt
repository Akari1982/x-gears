"Both Aveh and Kislev are
devoted to excavating the
ruins.<New>
Each country's strength
is increasing daily.<New>
Even if we could get the
help of all our comrades
to start a revolution...<New>

<TextBlock 3 w:48 h:3>
Excavating requires
tremendous amounts of
time, labor and capital.<New>
The best we can do with
our sand cruiser is find
small items in the sand.<Close><End of Block>
