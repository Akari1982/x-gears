You people...<Delay 30>
You're not residents here.<New>

I too, once lived near
the Royal Capital.<New>
I swindled people using
fake goods when I lived
there.<New>
I came to hate doing
those things...<New>
Then I heard of this place
from some pilgrims.<New>
I alternate gate duty
with the guy outside but,
it's pretty interesting.<New>
Everyday I see the
pilgrim's faces and get
impressions, like<New>
this person is very
troubled, <Delay 30>...and such.<New>
I used to use that
ability to get money
from people...<New>
Now I'd never think of 
doing that.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:52 h:4>
I'm from the royal army
stationed down south.<New>
I may work for the current
government but my heart
belongs to Nisan. I cannot
desert it.<New>
I hear there are lots of
people like me who are
gathering here.<New>
The residents here are
kindly renting me this
room...<New>
Now I'm waiting here
until something starts
happening.<Close><Close><End of Block>
