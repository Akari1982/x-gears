But,<Delay 5> I want to explain...<New>
Now<Delay 10> for the first time,<Delay 10>
people, on both earth and

But then,<Delay 10> not all of them<Delay 10>
are strong like the crew

people in Shevat.<New>
Even we almost lose sight
of our future at times...<Delay 10>
so you can imagine what
regular people go through.<New>
That's why people need
someone like you to
depend on...<Delay 10>
As a light to guide us.<New>
You freed the hearts of the
people that have been used
as tools by that Ministry

Elly, it was you!<Delay 10>
And now your body doesn't

Even if you come back
