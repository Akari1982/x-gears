Can't you tell!?

<TextBlock 3 w:34 h:2>
I'm working out.
...huff...<Delay 30>puff...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:50 h:2>
Gonna kick Solaris' butt.
...huff...<Delay 30>puff...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:48 h:2>
I have to get pumped up.

<TextBlock 6 w:46 h:2>
It's all over for them.

My last death blow skill.

"   Down with Solaris!!
     The world is ours!<Delay 20>
 
 But before all that...<Delay 40><Opcode 1 255>
   No gambling!
   No heavy drinking!
   Meet the deadlines
   Never give up!
   Take a bath!
   Don't listen to cry babies!
   Attend every morning!
   No unplanned trips!
   Keep the ocean clean!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:54 h:4>
Hey, haven't seen you
before. You new?<Delay 20>
Welcome to the Shevat
Liberation barracks!!<New>
...But in actuality, we
aren't as glorious as the
name may suggest.<Delay 20> Hahaha...<New>
But it is true that this
is the barracks for the
anti-Solaris troops.<Delay 20> Think
of this as home and relax.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:54 h:4>
But...we're in an odd
situation.<New>
We're picking a fight with
an organization that has
the power to manipulate
the world from the shadows.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:54 h:5>
Heh, and to think we're
all just a motley crew of
rioters from the land
below.<New>
We're just a bunch of 
people who've lived most of
our lives without knowing 
the existence of Shevat or
Solaris...<New>
Come to think of it, 
it almost sounds like a
joke.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:58 h:6>
So where did you fellas
come from? From the looks
of it, I'd guess you're
from the Ignas continent.<New>
Were you saved by the people
here too?<Delay 20> I understand. We 
were all in the same
situation.<New>
Everyone's got their unique
story on how they got
involved in this fiasco with
the Gebler and the 'Ethos'
and all.<New>
The usual pattern here is
that many of the people were
almost eliminated for some 
reason they don't know but 
were saved by the people here
before they were doomed.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:48 h:4>
That's basically it.<Delay 20> 
From now on we're all on
the same boat. <Delay 20>
Welcome aboard!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:50 h:5>
Back in Kislev, I used
to deal with homemade
medicines.<New>
By the way, I've heard 
rumors that the enemy
has some really cool
medicines.<New>
I wanted to learn some of
those techniques, so I
snuck into their shop
but...<Delay 20>I was a little
clumsy...heh.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:56 h:6>
I got desperate and somehow
managed to escape, and make
my way to Thames - the city
I had heard stories about.<Delay 20>
That's where the good people
here picked me up.<New>
If they hadn't picked me up
then, without a doubt, I 
would've been a guinea pig 
for their experimental 
drugs...<Delay 20>
Because I'm so cute.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:52 h:5>
Yeah!<Delay 20> Even if I were to
have returned back to the
land, they would probably
try to capture me again.<New>
It wouldn't matter how
many lives I had, it still
wouldn't be enough.<New>
So I've decided to stick
around here.
That's probably the case
for the majority of the
people here.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:5>
And anyway, don't you wanna
make the bad guys pay for
it?<Delay 20> They gotta be crazy if
they think we'll just take
this lying down!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:54 h:4>
Yo, this house is basically
an apartment for us land
dwellers that were saved.<New>
I've heard that there
aren't that many pure
Shevites in this town
anymore.<New>
Basically, it's been said
that a majority of them
were lost in that war with
Solaris 500 years ago.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:52 h:3>
Well, if we're not careful
ourselves, our fates may
be similar too. Heh.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:10 h:1>
Ha...<Opcode 2 10><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:60 h:5>
Yeah, they say this city used
to be like any other city 
when it was on the ground 
500 years ago.<New>
But after losing to Solaris, 
they launched just the 
palace block of the city up 
into the sky.<New>
It's basically an unbelievable
story, but in reality we're 
riding on that part of the 
city, and floating out in the
sky right now.<New>
In life, you never know what
to expect.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:56 h:5>
This is just between you and
me but, I am the one and 
only hope for Shevat.
I am the secret agent man...<Delay 20>
In other words, I'm a spy!<New>
Well? Ain't I cool?<Delay 20>
...But, come to think of it,
if you're here too, you 
guys are probably no
different than me...sigh...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:50 h:3>
Have you already met with
Queen Zephyr?<Delay 20> A very nice
person she is.<New>
We are all able to live
like this because the
Queen saved us.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:58 h:7>
That large white statue of
an angel at the entrance 
of the palace is a 
representation of a
particular woman who
sacrificed herself in that
war 500 years ago.<New>
It's so sad.<Delay 20> She was probably
the beloved heroine of
the rebellion back then.<Close><Close><End of Block>
