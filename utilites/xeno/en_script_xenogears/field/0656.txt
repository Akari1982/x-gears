"Good, you finally woke up!
You didn't move for so long

Fei
"Do you still intend to
kill me? Then go right
ahead and shoot me!<New>
But you'd better not do it
while we're in this forest.
Forest monsters hate loud
noises, you know!?"<Close><End of Block>

Mysterious Woman
"..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:42 h:4>
Fei
"Fine.
Don't talk to me if
you don't want to...<New>
But it wouldn't kill
you to thank me for
tending your wounds."<Close><End of Block>

"Th...thanks...<Delay 30>
but you shouldn't
have helped me.<New>
Don't think it will
save your life though.
It really doesn't
change a thing."<Close><End of Block>

"What are you
so afraid of?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:52 h:4>
Mysterious Woman
"I'm not afraid...
I'm just being cautious.<New>
It's natural for me to be
this cautious considering
I've met such a suspicious
surface dwelling -Lamb-."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:52 h:3>
Fei
"Hm... Don't you worry.
I'm not gonna do anything.<New>
Besides you're much more
suspicious than I am."<Close><End of Block>

"Huh...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:46 h:2>

Mysterious Woman
"I won't give my name to
a surface dweller -Lamb-."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:46 h:4>
Fei
"What's with you and
this 'Lamb' thing?<New>
We're both lost in this
forest, surrounded by
dangerous monsters...<New>
Shouldn't we at least
be cooperating with
each other until we
get out of here?"<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 19 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Good.<Delay 20>
So what's your name?<New>
It's going to be hard for
us to cooperate with one
another without at least
knowing each other's names.<New>
Anyway, my name is
Fei Fong Wong.<Delay 100>
You can call me Fei."<Close><End of Block>

Somehow I already<Delay 20>

<TextBlock 23 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Anyway, it's too dangerous
to travel in these parts
this late at night...<New>
Let's wait till daybreak
before we continue looking
for a way out of here...<Delay 20>
If that's okay with you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:36 h:3>
Elly
"I guess we have
no choice, do we?"<Close><End of Block>

How about having
something to eat."<Close><Close><End of Block>
