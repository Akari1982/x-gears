When I examined the broken

It must have had some new

for the Kislev army to send
pursuit forces after it."<Close><End of Block>

They will be investigating

<TextBlock 30 w:52 h:4>

"Most probably.<New>
And in that case, there

If they find where we have
hidden <Weltall>..."<Close><End of Block>

we should move <Weltall>

But staying here will

Fortunately, this is the
