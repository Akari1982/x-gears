It was a small village that

I ran away from there."<Close><End of Block>

"It was a nice, peaceful
village. Everyone there
treated me like family.<New>
Then, last night, a group
of Gears suddenly appeared
and started fighting right
in the middle of the place.<New>
The village was engulfed in
flames... I couldn't just
stand there and watch
Lahan be destroyed...<New>
So to try and save the
villagers, I got in an
empty Gear...without even
knowing how to operate it.<New>
I just thought maybe I
could do it...no...it
was more like someone
whispering to me...<New>
Someone whispering to me...
telling me to do it...
But it was a disaster!
The village..."<Close><End of Block>

you destroyed it?<New>
I thought you were

Fei
"I did try to help.
I actually took out
a few Gears.<New>
But then I came under
heavy fire from a new
group of Gears...<New>
And then my friend...<Delay 10>
Timothy...<Delay 10>was hit by
a hail of bullets...<New>
Then I lost it...<Delay 10>
Everything just went
dark..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:54 h:4>

"I don't remember anything
after that.<New>
The Gear I was in went out

Well, that's what doc said.<New>

was...<New>

Fei
"If they had never come
to the village, never
started fighting there...<New>
Then I wouldn't have
tried to pilot that Gear.
It's all their fault...
Not mine!<New>
They're the ones to blame.
If they'd never come...
none of this would have...

All you're saying is
'them, them, them'.<New>
Don't talk as if you

blame, as well!"<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"I'm to blame...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"Yes, that's right!<New>
Of course the direct cause
of the battle was that a
Gear made an emergency
landing in your village.<New>
But all Kislev wanted was
the Gear, right?
They weren't invading or
out to destroy Lahan.<New>
The real damage occured
because you climbed in a
Gear and tried to fight
back!"<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"What ever made you get
into that Gear?<New>
Not just anyone can pilot
them! It takes training!
There is no way a civilian
could hope to pilot one!<New>
Besides...you should have
been helping the villagers
flee to safety instead!<New>
How can you blame the
damage on a Gear when it
was your decision to fight
in it in the first place?<New>
Why don't you take some of
the responsiblity yourself?
Why are you putting all the
blame on others?<New>
That's just running away!
That's what makes you a
coward!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:52 h:4>
Fei
"Well, if you put it that
way... Yes...that's right,
I am a coward!<New>
I didn't realize my own
strength and have been
blaming what happened as a
result of that on others.<New>
I'm a pitiful excuse for a
man.
But...<New>
I just felt this rush of
blood in me and I couldn't
help myself! Couldn't help
myself...or help others."<Close><End of Block>

What do you know!?<New>
When I came to I was
surrounded by piles
of rubble...<New>
I didn't know what had
happened or what I had
done. I remembered
absolutely nothing.<New>
All I knew was that my
hands could still feel
what they had done.<New>
The only things that
penetrated the Gear's
barrier were screams...<New>
Screams accompanied by
the stench of blood, the
sound of crushing bones,
and my own curses.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:52 h:4>
Look! Look at my hands!
Can you hear their voices?
Can you understand this
feeling?<New>
The feeling of having
destroyed your village
with your own hands...?<New>
Of not being able to do
anything for the children
left behind...?<New>
Now they have nothing...
I have nothing...
I have nowhere...
no one..."<Close><End of Block>
