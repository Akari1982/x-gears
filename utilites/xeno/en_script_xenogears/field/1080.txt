"We investigated the cause

Our data showed a large

It was probably caused by
an overload of a battleship
class slave generator.<New>
The cause of this is still
unknown.<New>
The shockwaves from that
explosion took out two
thirds of the Aveh and 
Gebler forces combined.<New>
Now, Aveh is in the process
of regrouping their reserve
units, but that should take
at least several days."<Close><End of Block>
