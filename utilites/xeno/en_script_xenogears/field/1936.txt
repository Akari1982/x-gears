What's this place...?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:48 h:3>
...What's he done now!?
He only called you in
here for his own sake...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:50 h:3>
This is inside the shell
of your basic character,
the room of the 'coward'.<New>
I'm sure you've been here
many times before.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:34 h:3>
I see... 
I remember now...
In my dreams...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:54 h:5>
Everything despised and
unwanted he pushed onto me,
while he shut himself up
in his own little shell...
the 'coward' Fei.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:34 h:2>
The basis for our
personalities.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:38 h:2>
Who are you?
...Ah, you're my...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:3>
Hey...let's watch this
together! This is my most
treasured possession...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:44 h:5>
Hah...! By repeatedly
replaying the times he
was full of happiness
he lives in his own
happy little world.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:52 h:3>
While I'm still alive only
because of what's in those
left over dregs.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:44 h:2>
Here! I'll show you...
'everything' about me.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:50 h:5>
He pushed all the bad
things onto me...
but kept all the memories
filled with happiness and
mother's love to himself.<New>
And he shut himself away
with those memories
inside his own little
shell<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>forever.<Delay 10>
This is the place.<New>
What you see before you,
is what he made.
He just keeps hanging on
to those memories.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:44 h:1>
That's what this is...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:30 h:4>
Stop it!
Just stop it!
This...
These scenes...<New>
Are these all
there is to us?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:48 h:4>
Enough already!
There is nothing here!
Just a world filled with
deception and pain...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:46 h:3>
It can't be helped.
This is our world...
This is 'everything'...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:40 h:2>
No!
Get out!<New>
This is my room!<New>
I thought you would 
always be with me!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:54 h:3>
Why won't you see
reality? <New>
Happiness... Sadness...
Aren't these all parts that
combined to make the whole?<New>
Why won't you show him?
Why don't you also show
Id what you always watch!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:40 h:3>
No!
That's mine!<New>
I don't want to show
it to the person who
killed mother!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:36 h:3>
You should talk.
You're the one who
killed mother!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:42 h:4>
No I didn't, you did!
I did not kill her!<New>
Mother didn't care
for you<Delay 5>...<Delay 5>
Father didn't notice
either<Delay 5>...<New>
That's why you
killed her!<New>
I didn't kill her!
I didn't!
I didn't...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:28 h:1>
Knock it off!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:46 h:4>
...'We' killed mother.
It's no one's fault
but ours.<New>
It's not because she
became Miang or because
father didn't notice.<New>
Don't look outside for
the reason. Don't blame
anyone but yourself.<New>
Yes, mother was Miang,
and I know that you
suffered. No one could
have endured it.<New>
But you can't push it
onto Id alone.<New>
We are all one person.
We must all become one.
Right? Fei...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:54 h:3>
Walk on your own two feet!
Face up to the reality that
you don't want to see!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:38 h:3>
Show them to Id.
Everything you took
for yourself...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:50 h:3>
Lies! That woman...
This scene...
All illusions he made up!<New>
I, my consciousness, can
see through this trick.
I won't be swayed!<New>
I...! 
I...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:44 h:4>
Id...that's enough!
Doing that isn't going
to solve anything.<New>
Mother saved us at
the last moment.
That is the truth.
Right?<New>
The reality isn't
all grim, Id...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:44 h:4>
My power...
couldn't save anyone.
It only destroyed.<New>
I thought that I could
only make a connection
with others through
destruction.<New>
So I had to destroy
it all. People...
The world...<Delay 20>
Even Elly...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:40 h:4>
No...
That's not the case.<New>
We can save others
just as our mother,
despite being Miang,
saved us.<New>
Our power...
can save people<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>
We can save Elly!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:46 h:3>
...That's a first. 
Mother being so warm...<New>
To me...
she almost seems...
too warm...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:40 h:6>
Fei.
Take the memories
I have within me.
You must know what
it used to be like
up until now.<New>
Know our identity...
about who we are.
Then figure out what
ought to be done.<New>
Our integration is
not yet complete.<Close><Close><End of Block>
