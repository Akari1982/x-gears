"Oh my...
What an exquisite portrait!<New>
And the beautiful young
lady portrayed is quite
beyond comparison too..."<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"What is more...<Delay 30>
this looks rather
familiar...!"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"What do you think, Fei?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:50 h:4>
Fei
"Yes, I was just thinking
the same thing.<New>
The hair is a different
color, but the atmosphere
or personality about her
is exactly the same."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:36 h:4>
Citan
"What? <Delay 30>
Hair color?<Delay 30>
What do you mean?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:38 h:3>
Fei
"What do I mean?
Look...!<New>
It's the girl I met
in the forest..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"It's Elly! I mean...
there's something about her
that's just like Elly..."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"You don't think so...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:4>

"Yes, now that you mention
it...
She does resemble Elly."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"But that is not what I
was talking about...<New>
I meant that the brush
techniques and overall
style used in this picture
is similar to yours."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:24 h:2>
Fei
"...Really?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:26 h:2>
Fei
"Does it...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:38 h:4>
Fei
"First of all...
I'm nowhere near
as good an artist."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:48 h:3>
Citan
"No...it is very similar
to your style."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"But somehow I can sense
an atmosphere of sadness
in this picture."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"She is smiling, but in a
way, gives the impression
that she is anxious."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:54 h:3>
Citan
"Perhaps the picture is
reflecting her inner self?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Or perhaps it is the
inner feelings of the
artist being conveyed."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:42 h:4>
Citan
"Ahh...<New>
If you look closely,
you will notice that
the painting is not
completely finished."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:42 h:3>
"The artist put his
brushes down when it
was near completion."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:34 h:2>
Citan
"...Why is that?"<Close><End of Block>

Margie
"I don't know...<New>
But my grandmother
might have known
about it..."<Close><End of Block>

Margie
"Oh! What if we ask Agnes?
She may know something."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:44 h:3>

be with Sister Agnes."<Close><End of Block>

"Well...shall we head
back to the town for
now?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:44 h:3>
Citan
"Yes, alright...<New>
But this painting has
caught my curiosity.<New>
Do you mind if I speak
to Sister Agnes before
we head back to town?"<Close><End of Block>

"Yeah, okay...
We'll stop by her
room on the way out."<Close><End of Block>
