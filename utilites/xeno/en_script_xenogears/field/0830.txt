Is that waitress stupid? 
She said she has to go 
to block off the exit...<Close><End of Block>

My big brother worked in
that restaurant.
He caught so many bilkers
who try to dine and dash.<New>
He said he could tell who
would do that kinda thing.
Since he went into the army
there's a new waitress...<New>
I want to make it easy for
him to get his job back
when he returns.<New>
I mainly bug the waitress
and help the bilkers who
dine and dash get away.<Close><End of Block>

My big brother came back
but he's not working at
the restaurant.<New>
I'm doing my best to get
him a job soon. He says
he's gonna be a gardener.<Close><End of Block>

Yep, home is best.
No enemy bullets or
sergeant's fists. And
best of all is my family.<New>
The army taught me that
you have to do what you
want while you can.<Close><Close><End of Block>
