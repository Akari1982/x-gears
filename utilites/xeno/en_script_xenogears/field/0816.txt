When the Tournament starts,
Bart will enter the water-
way through the well and
head for the castle.<New>
If you swim against the
current you should reach
the castle.<New>
I am certain there will
still be some guards
there, so please dispose
of them quietly.<New>
We will make a good show
at the Tournament to draw
the guards' attention as
long as possible.<New>
During that time, you can
rescue Margie."<Close><End of Block>

Besides Citan's with him,

sneak into the castle

No problem."<Close><End of Block>

Thank you for coming here
in this desert heat.
I am a servant of the
Nisan Sect.<New>
Ever since Shakhan took
Mother Marguerite I've
been looking into ways
to get her back.<New>
I've been trying to find
out where she is being
held.<New>
I've been busy listening
to workers talk about
the comings and goings
from the castle...<New>
And giving food to the
guards who are preparing
for the Tournament to
loosen their lips too.<New>
Finally yesterday, I got
some information...
Margie's in the citadel.<New>
The problem is how to 
slip into the castle...<New>
I thought about it a lot
but it looks pretty bleak.
I'm sorry.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:50 h:3>
Bart
"No big deal. At least
we know where she is now.<New>
You just relax, we'll
find a way to slip into
the castle."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:54 h:3>
My apologies. If there
is anything else I can do
to help just ask...<New>
Do you have any good leads?<Close><End of Block>

Did you find a way 
into the castle?<Close><End of Block>

Good ideas?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:32 h:2>

Then we'll think
about the rest later."<Close><End of Block>

I see. I'm very relieved
that you are all here.
Please come see me again
if you hear anything new.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"I just remembered where
Bledavik's water supply
comes from...<New>
Spring water rises up from
under the castle and flows
to the town via a series
of underground waterways.<New>
We can sneak into the
castle by going through
these underground
waterways.<New>
We can get into them from
the town's well. The water-
ways should lead right up
to the castle's reservoir.<New>
If we are able to get that
far, we should be able to
sneak into the other rooms
of the castle from there."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"A good idea, except I
have one more suggestion.<New>
There is a festival going
on now. There must be a
way we can use it to our
advantage." <Close><End of Block>

I'm sure we'll find
something there.<Close><End of Block>

"Tomorrow is the 
Tournament. There will
be betting at the arena.<New>
Surely, the soldiers'
minds will be more on the

advantage."<Close><End of Block>

We will have him put
on a big show there."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:54 h:4>
Bart
"Tomorrow's the Tournament.<New>
Nothing's more popular than
gambling at these things.<New>
All the guards will be
betting. They'll all be
gambling.<New>
They'll be more interested
in the fight than their
jobs. We gotta use this.
Fei! You've gotta fight!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:20 h:2>
Fei
"Huh? Me?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:54 h:4>

"Everyone would know me.
Besides, I know the castle
well so I should sneak in."<Close><End of Block>

I'm sure today's the
last day to sign up for
the Tournament. You'd
better register soon.<Close><End of Block>

Fei already registered."<Close><End of Block>

"Tomorrow Fei will be in
the Tournament at Fatima
castle.<New>
We will put on a good show
to distract the guards.<New>
Then Bart will infiltrate
the castle through the
underground waterways
by way of the well.<New>
I will accompany Fei to
the Tournament. I will
also help work the crowd
and secure our escape."<Close><End of Block>

Fei is in the Tournament.
He will draw the guards'
