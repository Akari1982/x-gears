"This is the true meaning

To attain their respective
-Animus- and return to the
-Persona-.<New>

They regain their original
powers or functions by
aligning themselves with
their destined partner...<New>

its respective Anima Relic,
is but a puppet.<New>
It becomes a mere vessel
or container in which there
are no contents."<Close><End of Block>
