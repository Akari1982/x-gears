I've got to improve the
performance of my Gear
with the parts I've 
bought here...even if 
its only a little bit.<Close><End of Block>

I hear there are parts for
your Gear that increase its
performance and abilities
incredibly just by equipping
them on it...<New>
I wonder if they have any
such parts here...?
...Somehow, I doubt it.<Close><Close><End of Block>
