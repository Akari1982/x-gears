You thought I'd battle
right off? Get real!
Only the fast do well
at this game.
It's a card game for
'men of the sea'.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:60 h:3>
I'll explain the rules to you.
First I deal you and your
opponent 26 cards each.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:50 h:3>
Then I will place 4 cards
in front of each player
as your current hands.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:56 h:3>
And then, I place another
card on the left hand side
looking from your viewpoint.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:60 h:5>
Up to here I do automatically
for you. But from here on the
game starts.<New>
You must take your first 4
cards and the remaining 21
cards and place them all on
top of the two center cards
faster than your opponent can.<New>
Of course there are certain
rules for placing the cards.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:50 h:4>
Place a card on top of
another card if it is
numerically in order.
Like one number higher...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:50 h:2>
In this case, where there
is a 3 you can play a 4.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:44 h:1>
Or one number lower...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:2>
In this case, where there
is a 4 you can play a 3.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:36 h:2>
But if the numbers
aren't in order...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:58 h:3>
you can't play the card. But,
if there is a K (13) you can
play an A (1) and vice versa.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:56 h:6>
Now I'll teach you how
to control the cards.
First...<New>
To move a card from your
deck into an empty position
in the hand of 4 cards in
front of you, use Left and
Right on the Directional
button to pick the position.<New>
Then use either the
<S> button, <T> button,
L1 button, or R1 button
to place the card.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:46 h:3>
And to play a card, 
move on top of the card
you want to play...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:46 h:3>
And press the <T> button
or R1 button to play on
the right...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:46 h:3>
Or press the <S> button
or L1 button to play on
the left.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:48 h:2>
Of course your opponent 
is also playing cards.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:58 h:4>
What if neither of you
can play a card, even
after replacing the set of
4 cards in front of you?<New>
In this case there will be a
call of 'one-two', and a card
will be played directly from
your remaining pile of cards.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:14 h:1>
One-two<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:56 h:2>
If both players still can't
play, this will be repeated.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:56 h:3>
If there are no remaining
cards on your pile to play
at the 'one-two' call...<New>
then the left-most card from
the set of cards in front of
you will be played directly.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:14 h:1>
One-two<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:12 h:1>
And...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:48 h:3>
The first player to use
up all their cards wins.
In this case you lose.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:58 h:4>
Oh, and one more thing.<New>
By pushing the Select button,
you can quit a game midway
through. But of course this
will mean you lose.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:48 h:4>
By the way, there are
lots of good players
onboard the Thames.<New>
How about starting off
by playing my mate here?
    Sure
    No thanks<Close><End of Block>
