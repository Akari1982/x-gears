...The number one gate
generator is 200 kelt
southwest of Nortune and
4000 sharl underground.<New>
Its interference waves make
guided weapon use impossible
in this area. So up to the
last minute the Hecht must
be piloted manually.<New>
After canceling stealth
mode, you will provide
direct escort for the Hecht
inside the enemy defense
zone. Any questions?<Close><End of Block>

That is classified.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:52 h:4>
Elly 
"But without knowing our
objective, our response to
any orders will be slow.<New>
Even if we're just ordered
to provide cover.
We need to at least know
the attack objective..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:56 h:4>
The objective will be issued
during the mission.
It will be relayed directly
to the Hecht's pilots.<Close><End of Block>

<TextBlock 9 w:52 h:5>
Your only concern is to
protect the Hecht from
the enemy's anti-aircraft 
weapons. <Delay 60>
Any problems with that?<Close><End of Block>

Confirm terrain, weather
and enemy defense details
with the information at
hand.<New>
The mission starts at
1700.
Until then wait in your
assigned units.<New>
I shouldn't have to
remind you that this
mission is a purge.<New>
Remember, we have
complete authority

Dismissed.<Close><End of Block>

How can we go along with

do with us?"<Close><End of Block>
