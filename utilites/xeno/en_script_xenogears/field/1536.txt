Long ago, humans were with
god in a paradise in the
sky called Mahanon. The
place was protected by the
power of god. Humans were
never exposed to the fear
or danger of death.<New>
However, one day, humans
entered god's forbidden
garden and ate a fruit
which bestowed upon them
tremendous intelligence
and power.<New>
God found out about the
incident and the humans
were banished from the
paradise. The prosperous
times were over, an era of
sorrow and hatred began...<Close><End of Block>

Humans banished from the
paradise were foolish
enough to revolt against
god.<New>
In order to resist the
power of god, they
created twelve Anima
Relics, and called
themselves gods...<New>
For 10 days, 10 nights,
the world shed its blood,
Mahanon was enveloped in 
flames.<New>
But human strength was no
match for god and the
arrogant humans were
destroyed by god's anger.
Only a few righteous men
were left on the land.<New>
However, god was also
tired and wounded.
He decided to rest in the
deepest depths of the
earth. <New>
God's rest was long.
But eternity is only
a moment to god.<New>
Since then, the righteous
men who didn't revolt
against god had to live
in the harsh nature by
themselves, being in
constant fear of death...<Close><End of Block>

The legend also says the
following:<Delay 20>
When the righteous men's
children are born again,
god will awaken from his

If Solaris attains that
power, no one will be able
to stop them.<Delay 20>

world then...?<Close><Close><End of Block>
