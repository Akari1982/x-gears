Grahf came seeking
the power that
exists within me.<New>
To return to his
own body.<New>
You understand now,

Grahf is<Delay 5>...<Delay 20>Lacan.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:50 h:5>
We, his descendants who
inherited his lingering
thoughts and memories
from him, know only too
well...<New>
Divided 500 years ago...
He would became a part
of us both...<New>
Lacan became Grahf.
He destroyed everything
on the face of the earth.<New>
He then mastered how
to possess the bodies
of others by dwelling
in their minds.<New>
He was probably enabled
to do this after his
contact with the
'Existence'.<New>
The bodies died but
Lacan's spirit
continued living by
possessing others.<New>
He had come that day
to return his soul, at
last, to the perfect
reincarnation of his
physical body...<New>
The body of 'Fei'.<Close><End of Block>
