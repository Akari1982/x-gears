"...The gate we control
was removed by will of
the Emperor. <New>
However, there are 
foolish beasts here 
defiling our holy land

These beasts destroyed
the gate and want to remove
the Emperor from the throne
in the confusion.<New>
This is a grave matter,
the Emperor's throne
has been polluted.
We cannot rest yet.<New>

<Opcode 14 1>     My beloved children, you
     can be at ease. The Gazel
     Ministry and I planned
     the destruction of the
     gate long ago.
     The people chosen by god...<Delay 10>
     we, the Gazel, will return
     to god's paradise. To the
     sleeping mother god...<Delay 10>
     The time for our
     immortality has come.<New>
     We have opened the the door
     to 'Mahanon'...the place
     where god rests, the source
     of wisdom and power. The
     surface dwellers will no
     doubt use this opportunity
     to seize its power.
     However, there is no need
     to be concerned...
     As long as Solaris has
     this power...<Close><End of Block>
