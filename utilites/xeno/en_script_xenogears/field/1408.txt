Kim
"Think about it.<New>
What's the purpose of
fighting each other on
such a tiny planet as
this?<New>
Fighting out of fear
of being hunted into
a corner...<New>
Rushing in to fight as
if there were only so
many 'reserved seats'
to the right of life..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:54 h:4>
Kim
"Starting a war is stupid.
Inciting it is also stupid.<New>
Killing people as an act of
terrorism or as a protest
against wars that kill
people is just as stupid.<New>
You're all fools!"<Close><End of Block>

Kim
"Is that a good enough
reason for that child,
or those dead people?<New>
It wasn't much of an
operation. It was
difficult but there was
enough chance to win...<New>
We'd have won if we had 
better equipment...<New>
That child would have
been saved if there
was electricity..."<Close><End of Block>

Kim
"It's not just that child.<New>
Five people died in my 
hospital.
The ICU didn't function..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:52 h:4>
Kim
"Stupid. Just fools.
Humans, creatures are
meant to live.<New>
Why do they want to
die out?
Why do they strangle
themselves?<New>
Humans are defective
creatures.
A bunch of fools!<New>
That's why genetic damage
is up lately. The birth
rate is also going down.<New>
Only 30 years to live...
Nature, this planet, won't
allow humans to live any
longer than that."<Close><End of Block>

"...Kim, I felt sorry for
that child.<New>
But I don't think people
in Ravine destroyed the
generator with that
intention.<New>
They don't have any other
ways to express themselves.<New>
The government is the one
to blame."<Close><End of Block>
